**"Online Images Amplify Gender Bias"**. This talk/paper, forthcoming at _Nature_ has the distinction of being significantly co-authored by a MACSS alumnus, Bhargav Srinivasa Desikan! Because its under embargo, I'll send the paper to student via the listserve. 

Each year, people spend less time reading and more time viewing images, which are proliferating online. Images from platforms like Google and Wikipedia are downloaded by millions every day, and millions more are interacting via social media like Instagram and TikTok that primarily consist of exchanging visual content. In parallel, news agencies and digital advertisers are increasingly capturing attention online through the use of images, which people process more quickly, implicitly, and memorably than text. Here, we show that the rise of images online significantly exacerbates gender bias, both in its statistical prevalence and its psychological impact. We examine the gender associations of 3,495 social categories (such as nurse or banker) in over one million images from Google, Wikipedia, and IMDb, as well as in billions of words from these platforms. We find that gender bias is consistently more prevalent in images than text for both female- and male-typed categories. We further show that the documented underrepresentation of women online is substantially worse in images compared to not only text, but also public opinion and US census data. Finally, we conducted a nationally representative, pre-registered experiment which shows that googling for images rather than textual descriptions of occupations amplifies gender bias in participantsâ€™ beliefs. Addressing the societal impact of this large-scale shift toward visual communication will be essential for developing a fair and inclusive future for the internet.
