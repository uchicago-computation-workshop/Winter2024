**How science is (mis)communicated in online media**. Most academics are promoting their work online. At the same time, the public, journalists, and interested governments increasingly turn to online platforms for scientific information. It thus becomes ever more critical that we better understand how science is disseminated in online news, social media, blogs and knowledge repositories. My talk will summarize our work about (1) how subsequently retracted articles receive outsized attention online, (2) how scientific publications spread on various types of online platforms, losing essential information, and (2) how gender impacts the coverage of scholarship. Our findings highlight detrimental heterogeneities in online science sharing. They inform efforts to curb the online spread of science-related misinformation and close gaps in scholars’ visibility. Consider the following 4 papers: [**1**](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2119086119), [**2**](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/22153/21932), [**3**](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2102945118), [**4**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05330).

**"Private Linear Regression"**. Some researchers and practitioners (including social scientists, political scientists, economists, and healthcare scientists) crucially rely on statistical methods to further the study of individuals, society, and human behavior via inferential analysis. Unfortunately, the naive application and release of resulting statistics could reveal sensitive information about the individuals in the dataset. As a result, differential privacy (DP) has been proposed as a strong definition of privacy that can prevent reconstruction, membership, and inference attacks. However, we are still in the nascent stages of understanding the statistical validity of DP methods. One of the most fundamental statistical techniques is linear regression, commonly used for predicting, testing, and augmenting relationships between two or more variables. In this talk, I will discuss my algorithmic and analytic contributions to private linear regression, showcasing the capabilities and limits of such methods in a range of settings.

The following papers are associated with the talk. 1) https://jmlr.org/papers/v24/23-0045.html (JMLR 2023): focuses on the problem of private hypothesis testing with applications to predicting social and economic mobility; 2) https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/37373632 (PhD Dissertation, 2022): Chapters 1 and 2 contains basics for differential privacy, which should provide enough background of what differential privacy is and the contexts in which it can be applied; 3) https://petsymposium.org/popets/2022/popets-2022-0041.php (PoPETS 2022): focuses on the problem of private estimation with a focus on the Opportunity Atlas tool.

**"Online Images Amplify Gender Bias"**. This talk/paper, forthcoming at _Nature_ has the distinction of being significantly co-authored by a MACSS alumnus, Bhargav Srinivasa Desikan! Because its under embargo, I'll send the paper to student via the listserve. 

Each year, people spend less time reading and more time viewing images, which are proliferating online. Images from platforms like Google and Wikipedia are downloaded by millions every day, and millions more are interacting via social media like Instagram and TikTok that primarily consist of exchanging visual content. In parallel, news agencies and digital advertisers are increasingly capturing attention online through the use of images, which people process more quickly, implicitly, and memorably than text. Here, we show that the rise of images online significantly exacerbates gender bias, both in its statistical prevalence and its psychological impact. We examine the gender associations of 3,495 social categories (such as nurse or banker) in over one million images from Google, Wikipedia, and IMDb, as well as in billions of words from these platforms. We find that gender bias is consistently more prevalent in images than text for both female- and male-typed categories. We further show that the documented underrepresentation of women online is substantially worse in images compared to not only text, but also public opinion and US census data. Finally, we conducted a nationally representative, pre-registered experiment which shows that googling for images rather than textual descriptions of occupations amplifies gender bias in participants’ beliefs. Addressing the societal impact of this large-scale shift toward visual communication will be essential for developing a fair and inclusive future for the internet.
